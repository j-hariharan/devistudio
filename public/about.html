        <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>

        <p>
            Hailing from Bangalore, the garden city, also called the IT hub of India, we at Devi Studio are passionate
            about
            photography and videography that captures a multitude of emotions and memories during your events.

            Rather than artificial poses before the camera, our photographers will unobtrusively walk around, looking
            for
            those living moments and photograph them, to be preserved for you to enjoy, reminisce and reflect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Photography is an art that is mastered with experience, when one starts to play with speed and light.

            photography is all about capturing the emotions during the D-day. With an experience of over 40 years in
            this
            field, we are masters at our art and will make sure that not a single memory slips away from our lenses.

            Our vision at Devi Studio is to provide the best services to our client keeping in mind the client's
            satisfaction levels at all stages of our assignment.
